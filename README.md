# Practical Guide to Distilling Large Models into Small Models: A Novel Approach with Extended Distillation
Comparing Traditional and Enhanced Step-by-Step Distillation: Adaptive Learning, Cosine Similarity, and Curriculum-Based Rationale Supervision
In this paper, I embark on a journey to uncover the secrets behind transferring "big model" intelligence to smaller, more agile models using two distinct distillation techniques: Traditional Distillation and Step-by-Step Distillation. Imagine having a wise, resource-heavy teacher model that not only gives the right answer but also explains its thought process - like a master chef sharing both the recipe and the secret tricks behind it. Our goal is to teach a lean, efficient student model to emulate that expertise using just the distilled essence of knowledge.
To make these ideas crystal clear, I illustrate each technique using simple Logistic Regression demos. Although Logistic Regression is far simpler than deep neural networks, it serves as an excellent canvas to experiment with concepts like temperature scaling, weighted losses, and even simulating a "chain-of-thought" through intermediate linear scores. For Traditional Distillation, our student learns from the teacher's soft probability outputs, balancing hard label accuracy with the subtle cues of soft labels. Meanwhile, Step-by-Step Distillation goes one step further by also incorporating the teacher's internal reasoning process.
Finally, I introduce an improved step-by-step distillation method that makes learning more stable and efficient. By adding gradual rationale loss ramp-up, cosine similarity for reasoning alignment, and stronger consistency regularization, the student better adapts to the teacher's logic while staying focused on the final predictions. These tweaks smooth out training, boost generalization, and keep the optimization stable.
